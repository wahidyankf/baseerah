## Prerequisites

- **Prior topics**: `creating-ai-powered-apps` (prompting, structured output, and RAG -- the
  alternatives this course requires you to exhaust first) -- `[Unverified]` this course is not yet
  present in the AyoKoding course library on disk, so no link is given here; `evaluating-ai-systems-in-depth`
  (**hard prerequisite**: a fine-tune with no eval is unfalsifiable, and every decision in this
  course is an eval comparison) -- `[Unverified]` not yet present in the AyoKoding course library on
  disk; [Statistics for Evaluation](../../statistics-for-evaluation/overview.md) (the
  base-versus-adapted comparison is a paired significance test, not two printed numbers);
  [Inference Serving & Model Deployment](../../inference-serving-and-model-deployment/overview.md)
  (where an adapter is actually served); `data-engineering` (the
  dataset pipeline) -- `[Unverified]` not yet present in the AyoKoding course library on disk; **just
  enough python** ([4 · Just Enough Python](../../just-enough-python/learning/overview.md)) is
  assumed for reading and writing fully type-annotated Python.
- **Tools & environment**: a macOS/Linux terminal; **Python 3.13**, the standard library only
  (`json`, `math`, `dataclasses`, `pathlib`, `typing`) -- no fine-tuning library, no network call, no
  real Hugging Face download, and no paid API key is required anywhere in this topic, deliberately.
  Every base model, tokenizer, and trainer this topic's examples reference is mocked exactly the way
  a real object's shape and failure modes behave.
- **Assumed knowledge**: the model-application material and its eval discipline; what tokens and a
  context window are; loading and transforming a dataset in Python; the idea of gradient-based
  training at a conceptual level. **No deep-learning course is assumed** -- this course explains what
  it needs and does not teach model architecture or backpropagation theory.

## Why this exists -- the big idea

**The problem before the solution**: fine-tuning is the intuitive response to "the model does not do
what I want," and it is usually the wrong one. **The one idea worth keeping if you forget everything
else**: fine-tuning teaches behaviour, not facts -- exhaust prompting, retrieval, and scoping first,
and when you do adapt, the dataset is the whole job.

**Cross-cutting big ideas**: `correctness-vs-pragmatism` -- adaptation is a costly bet on a measured
gap, not a default; `abstraction-and-its-cost` -- an adapter is a compact approximation of a full
fine-tune, with the trade-offs approximations carry; `taming-state` -- adapted weights are a
versioned artefact with a lifecycle, not a configuration change.

## Confirm your toolchain

Every example in this topic is standard-library-only -- no fine-tuning library, no network call, no
real GPU, and no paid API key required anywhere:

```text
$ python3 --version
Python 3.13.12
$ python3 -c "import json, math, dataclasses, pathlib, typing; print('stdlib primitives OK')"
stdlib primitives OK
$ pyright --version
pyright 1.1.411
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.15.9
```

_Captured 2026-07-26 -- these are point-in-time patch versions, not a durable claim; see this
topic's [Accuracy notes](../overview.md#accuracy-notes) if you are reading this after a later patch
has shipped._

Every worked example is a complete, self-contained, fully type-annotated (strict `pyright`) runnable
Python file colocated under `learning/code/`, actually executed against **Python 3.13** to capture
its documented output -- every printed value on this topic's pages is a genuine, captured transcript,
never a fabricated one. Every code-bearing worked example is independently runnable with no
cross-example imports; the capstone's five files are the sole exception, each committing a JSON
artefact the next step's file reads, so the five steps run as one small, ordered project.

## How this topic's examples are organized

- **[Band A -- The Decision, Not the Technique](./band-a-the-decision-not-the-technique.md)**
  (Examples 1-16, 51-58) -- measuring a real gap, triaging behaviour-shaped versus knowledge-shaped
  complaints, exhausting prompting/retrieval/scoping in that order, the written decision gate,
  legitimate cases the gate should pass, and the costs nobody budgets.
- **[Band B -- The Dataset and the Training Run](./band-b-the-dataset-and-the-training-run.md)**
  (Examples 17-34, 59-67) -- assembling and auditing a supervised fine-tuning dataset, sourcing
  strategies and their biases, leak-free splits, full fine-tuning versus parameter-efficient
  adapters, rank as a capacity knob, and the hyperparameters that actually matter.
- **[Band C -- Evaluation, Distillation, and Operation](./band-c-evaluation-distillation-and-operation.md)**
  (Examples 35-50, 68-75) -- the paired comparison against the base, the forgetting-regression
  suite, overfitting invisible in training loss, distillation's ceiling, serving and hot-swapping
  adapters, version pinning, and retirement.
- **[Capstone](./capstone/overview.md)** -- the complete adaptation arc for one real behaviour gap: a
  measured decision gate, a curated and audited dataset, a rank-justified adapter, a paired
  evaluation with a forgetting-regression suite, a served swappable artefact, and a written
  maintenance and retirement plan.
