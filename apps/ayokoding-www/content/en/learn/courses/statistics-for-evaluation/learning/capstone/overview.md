## The capstone: a statistically defensible evaluation report

The capstone produces a complete, statistically defensible evaluation report for one real decision
from `evaluating-ai-systems-in-depth` -- `[Unverified]`
not yet present in the AyoKoding course library on disk, so no link is given here -- should this
candidate change ship? Every claim in the final report carries its own uncertainty, every agreement
number is chance-corrected and read against the human ceiling, the run comparison is paired and
corrected for multiple comparisons, and the regression bar is derived from a measured noise floor
rather than chosen by feel. Every script lives under `learning/capstone/code/`, fully
type-annotated, and was actually run against **Python 3.13** to capture the output shown below.

- **Step 1 -- [`sampling-plan.md`](./sampling-plan.md) + `sample.py`**: a written sampling plan with
  a justified n, and a stratified, reweighted sample. Ties together co-06, co-07, co-08, co-24.
- **Step 2 -- `agreement.py`**: chance-corrected human-human agreement and per-criterion judge
  concordance, each with a bootstrap interval, each read beside its label prevalence and the human
  ceiling. Ties together co-09-co-16, co-24.
- **Step 3 -- `compare.py`**: a paired comparison of candidate against baseline across every
  criterion, corrected for multiple comparisons, separating statistical detectability from
  practical importance. Ties together co-17-co-19, co-21.
- **Step 4 -- `noise_floor.py` + [`report.md`](./report.md)**: the suite's own measured noise
  floor, decomposed into its two variance sources, a regression bar derived from it, and the
  assembled final report. Ties together co-20, co-22, co-23, co-24.

**Concepts exercised**: co-01-co-24 -- every concept this topic teaches, converging on one
recommendation traceable to the statistics, never to a bare point estimate.

## Step 1: sample.py -- a justified sampling plan, reweighted

**Context**: Theme A's ex-08/ex-20 and Theme B's ex-15/ex-16 built sample-size planning and
stratified reweighting separately. This step combines both into one written plan (see
[`sampling-plan.md`](./sampling-plan.md) for the plan itself) and a synthetic, three-stratum
population where the true overall rate is known -- so the reweighted estimate's own accuracy can be
verified against ground truth, not merely asserted.

```

**Run**: `python3 sample.py`

**Output**:

```text
Target effect: candidate-vs-baseline overall pass-rate estimate for the ship decision
Target precision (half-width): 0.05
Strata: ('general', 'edge-case-formatting', 'edge-case-safety')
Unstratified reference n: 217
Actual stratified allocation: {'general': 200, 'edge-case-formatting': 60, 'edge-case-safety': 60} (total n=320)
(Synthetic ground truth, for verification only) true overall population rate: 0.8250
Simulated achieved 95% half-width at this allocation: 0.0441
Naive pooled estimate: 0.7250 | Reweighted estimate: 0.8087
Naive error: 0.1000 | Reweighted error: 0.0162
MATCH: this plan's allocation achieves its own stated precision by simulation, and the reweighted estimate recovers the known synthetic population rate more accurately than naive pooling
```

**Acceptance criteria**: the simulated achieved 95% half-width (`0.0441`) sits at or below the
plan's own `0.05` target precision, satisfying co-06's rule that a sampling plan's n is justified by
simulation, not merely asserted. On the synthetic population with a known true rate (`0.8250`), the
reweighted estimate's error (`0.0162`) is smaller than the naive pooled estimate's error (`0.1000`),
satisfying co-08's rule that reweighting recovers a known population rate more accurately than
ignoring stratum weights.

**Key takeaway**: a sampling plan is defensible when its own precision claim is checked by
simulation before data collection, and a reweighted estimate is defensible when it is verified
against a KNOWN ground truth, not merely computed and trusted.

**Why It Matters**: this is the evidence [`sampling-plan.md`](./sampling-plan.md) cites for its own
`n=320` allocation -- a plan that states a number without this kind of justification is a guess
wearing the shape of a plan.

## Step 2: agreement.py -- chance-corrected concordance against the human ceiling

**Context**: Theme C built every piece of this step separately -- chance correction (ex-24),
choosing the right coefficient (ex-26), prevalence reporting (ex-29), bootstrap intervals (ex-30),
and the human ceiling (ex-33). This step runs all three of this decision's real rubric criteria
through the full pipeline at once, verifying every coefficient twice along the way.

MATCH: every criterion's judge-vs-human kappa AND human-ceiling kappa were each verified from-definition against the pinned library, and every judge kappa sits below its own human ceiling
```

**Acceptance criteria**: every criterion's judge-human kappa is verified equal from-definition and
via the library (co-10), each carries a bootstrap interval that brackets its own point estimate
(co-13), each is reported beside its label prevalence (co-12), and every judge kappa
(`0.6050`/`0.6939`/`0.3112`) sits below its own human-human ceiling
(`0.7506`/`0.7191`/`0.3761`) rather than against perfect agreement (co-16). All hold, matching the
captured output above.

**Key takeaway**: "the judge agrees with humans" is unreportable as a single number -- it takes
three criteria, three prevalences, three intervals, and three human ceilings, and none of the three
criteria's numbers may be pooled into one.

**Why It Matters**: `tone`'s judge kappa (`0.3112`) is barely half of `correctness`'s (`0.6050`) --
a ship decision that trusted the judge equally on both criteria would be badly miscalibrated on
`tone`, exactly the failure per-criterion concordance reporting exists to prevent.

## Step 3: compare.py -- a corrected, paired, materiality-aware comparison

**Context**: Theme D built pairing (ex-37/38), significance-vs-importance (ex-39/40), and
multiple-comparisons correction (ex-43/44) separately. This step runs all three rubric criteria's
paired comparisons at once, deliberately planting one real effect and one phantom, to verify the
corrected pipeline tells them apart.

```

**Run**: `python3 compare.py`

**Output**:

```text
[correctness] baseline=0.7200 candidate=0.9600 gap=+0.2400 uncorrected_p=0.0033
[safety] baseline=0.9200 candidate=0.8000 gap=-0.1200 uncorrected_p=0.0412
[tone] baseline=0.7600 candidate=0.8000 gap=+0.0400 uncorrected_p=0.7237
[correctness] corrected_significant=True material=True
[safety] corrected_significant=False material=True
[tone] corrected_significant=False material=False
MATCH: the corrected pipeline finds the planted real effect (correctness) significant and material, and rejects the planted phantom (safety) despite its uncorrected p < 0.05
```

**Acceptance criteria**: `safety`'s uncorrected p-value (`0.0412`) crosses the ordinary `0.05`
threshold despite `baseline_rate == candidate_rate` (a planted phantom, no real difference), and
Bonferroni correction across all three criteria correctly reclassifies it as not significant
(co-21). `correctness`'s planted real effect survives correction AND clears the `0.05` materiality
threshold (co-17, co-19). All hold, matching the captured output and the script's own asserts.

**Key takeaway**: an uncorrected `p < 0.05` on any ONE of several tested criteria is not yet
evidence of a real difference -- `safety`'s own phantom proves the correction step is not
optional, even with only three criteria tested.

**Why It Matters**: this is the exact evidence [`report.md`](./report.md) cites for recommending
against a `safety`-only justification while still recommending the ship on `correctness`'s own
merits -- a decision the uncorrected numbers alone would have gotten wrong in the opposite
direction (trusting `safety`'s phantom, or under-weighting `correctness`'s real, corrected win).

## Step 4: noise_floor.py -- a measured regression bar

**Context**: Theme D's ex-45 built the noise-floor decomposition technique on a standalone
fixture. This step applies it to THIS candidate's own "correctness" eval set, deriving a regression
bar the final [`report.md`](./report.md) uses instead of a chosen-by-feel threshold.

**Run**: `python3 noise_floor.py`

**Output**:

```text
Population: 400 cases, mean true pass probability 0.6986
Generation variance: empirical=0.003562 closed-form=0.003695
Case-sampling variance: 0.000334
Total variance: 0.004241 | Sum of components: 0.003896
Noise floor stdev: 0.0651 | Derived regression bar: 0.1303
MATCH: this candidate's own measured noise floor derives a regression bar well below compare.py's planted 0.24 real-effect gap -- that gap is not explainable by ordinary re-run noise alone
```

**Acceptance criteria**: the empirical generation variance (`0.003562`) matches its closed form
(`0.003695`) within `10%` (co-23), the empirical total variance (`0.004241`) matches the sum of its
two components (`0.003896`) within `20%` (co-22, co-23), and the derived regression bar (`0.1303`)
sits below `compare.py`'s own planted `0.24` real-effect gap on `correctness` (co-22). All hold,
matching the captured output and the script's own asserts.

**Key takeaway**: a regression bar derived from a measured decomposition of THIS candidate's own
re-run noise is a fundamentally different claim than a bar picked because "5 points felt like
enough" -- and here, it is comfortably smaller than the real, planted effect, confirming the
`correctness` gap is not noise.

**Why It Matters**: this is the final piece [`report.md`](./report.md) assembles alongside Step 2's
agreement evidence and Step 3's corrected comparison -- together, the three form one statistically
defensible recommendation, none of the three pieces sufficient alone.
