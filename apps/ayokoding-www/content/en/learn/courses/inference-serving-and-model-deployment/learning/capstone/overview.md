## Goal

Stand up and tune a self-hosted inference service for a small open-weights model against a stated
latency SLO and a realistic workload distribution: continuous batching over a paged KV cache with
prefix sharing, an admission and scheduling policy chosen deliberately on the throughput/latency
frontier, a documented GPU memory budget, a quantization decision backed by a measured quality
evaluation, an autoscaling policy that survives cold starts, full serving observability -- and a
defensible build-versus-buy recommendation. The whole thing runs end to end against the committed
simulator, offline, with no GPU and no downloaded model weights.

## Concepts exercised

- [x] prefill/decode phases and the bandwidth-bound decode (co-02-co-04)
- [x] KV cache arithmetic and its role as the scarce resource (co-05-co-07, co-18)
- [x] paged allocation and prefix sharing (co-08-co-10)
- [x] continuous batching, scheduling, admission control, preemption (co-11-co-14)
- [x] the throughput/latency frontier and the four latency metrics (co-15-co-17)
- [x] quantization evaluated rather than assumed (co-19)
- [x] capacity planning and realistic load testing against a length distribution (co-21, co-22)
- [x] autoscaling with cold starts, packaging, staged model rollout (co-23-co-25)
- [x] serving observability (co-26)
- [x] a total-cost-of-ownership decision (co-27, co-28)

## Step 1: `serve/` -- serve the model and document the memory budget

Serves the model, instruments the four distinct latency metrics from co-16, and documents the GPU
memory budget with the cache arithmetic that yields a maximum concurrency. This step's output feeds
directly into Step 2's scheduler as the cache budget it schedules against.

**`learning/capstone/code/serve/server.py`**

```python
"""Capstone step 1 -- serve/: serve the model, instrument the four latency metrics, and document the
GPU memory budget with the cache arithmetic that yields a maximum concurrency.

Reuses the exact formulas taught in Examples 1, 11, 14, 16, and 59 -- nothing here is new arithmetic,
only their assembly into one importable module the rest of the capstone builds on.

admission never exceeds it -- the documented number and the observed scheduling behavior match.

## Step 2: `scheduler/` -- continuous batching, paged cache, prefix sharing, preemption

Implements continuous batching over a paged cache with prefix sharing, plus an admission and
scheduling policy with preemption under pressure -- and a contiguous, static-batching baseline to
measure the improvement against.

`contiguous_cache_bytes` on an identical, fragmentation-prone workload;
`test_no_request_class_starves_under_the_scheduler` drives `run_to_completion()` and confirms every

## Step 3: `tune/` -- the throughput/latency frontier and a measured quantization decision

SAME 100-request distribution the capacity model was derived from;
`test_autoscaling_policy_accounts_for_measured_cold_start` confirms the proactive policy scales out
strictly earlier than a naive policy would, at the identical queue depth.

## Step 5: `operate/` -- packaging, observability, rollout, and the build-versus-buy call

Packages weights, runtime, and configuration as one versioned artifact; wires the serving
observability dashboard; executes a staged model rollout with a quality guardrail and a rollback;
concludes with the build-versus-buy recommendation, using realistic utilization rather than a
full-load assumption.
